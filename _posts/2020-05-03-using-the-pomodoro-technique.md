## The Secret Sauce To Productivity

Getting the opportunity to work from home is something that I look for in a job. The ability to work from home means that I get some quiet time with my thoughts as I work and it also gives me the ability to be a little more leisurely with how I work because there is no pressure to try to get something done in between people coming over for a chat or needing some help. Don't get me wrong, I love to help people, I love to educate people on the things I've learned and to learn from their experience. But sometimes I just need time away from all of that so I can sit and code or generate more content for the Dojo.

But working from home presents its challenges. What I'm referring to here is focusing on work instead of dealing with all of the other office activities. Working from home is providing me this slice of time to be "out of sight, out of mind" and completely virtual to my team and my meetings. This means that I can use this opportunity to embrace asynchronous communication and get down to getting things done. But... I'm only human, I can't focus on something forever.

## Finding A Little Zen

Or can I? Enter the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). This is something that I use in both my personal and professional life to get things done. What is a Pomodoro you ask? Its Italian for tomato and the author just happened to have an egg timer shaped like a tomato, hence the name. There, mystery solved.

It's quite a simple technique and it helps me to focus. All you have to do is pick an amount of time that you want to be undisturbed, normally I choose the default of ``` 25 minutes ```. I feel like this is the optimal time for me to get things done and focus. You set your timer and you are off to work focusing on that [singular task](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22632368-singletasking). Once the time is up however you set a ``` 5 minute ``` timer and step away from your computer! The goal here is to take a break away from focusing. Get up, get some coffee if you drink it, walk around and stare outside, just don't focus on your task at hand. This is a break and should be treated like one. Once the ``` 5 minute ``` timer is up then its back to work again for another ``` 25 minutes ```. You can repeat this process over and over again until the task you are working on is complete. I usually allow myself to go for 3 full pomodoros with 3 breaks before I take a larger break of ``` 15 minutes ```.  

This technique is great and I would highly recommend it for productivity. There are a few caveats however that I would mention.

- Take the longer break when it presents itself
  
  This is key. I tried to do it before where I never took the long break and I was burnt out __for the week__ because I just couldn't take thinking anymore.

- You don't have to be strict about the timing
  
  I've had meetings and phone calls break my Pomodoro early. The key is to start back up the minute you are free to get the most out of focus time or start a brand new pomodoro after. Purists would prefer the latter technique.

- Know what you are going to work on before you work on it.
  
  This is very important. The entire point of a pomodoro is to do deep work. Spending time figuring out what you are going to do is time lost.

## Estimation

One thing that I happened to left out was the amount of estimation that is required to make this effective. You could just set a timer and work for short bursts and find some amount of success. The real added benefit is to define the work and then map that work to a timer. You will not only get more work done, but it will also be deeply focused on the outcome. This allows me to batch tasks such as taking out the trash, doing dishes, and running the vacuum. Before I started applying this technique, those were three different tasks that would take a total of 15 minutes each. Once I tied them to the technique I was able to see that I could take a total of 25 minutes most of the time and cross all three tasks off of my list. This helped me to get more work done, but it also helped to break down my mental barriers to doing this kind of work. Knowing that it takes 5 minutes to clean my bathroom is something that is easier to swallow than seeing the task ```clean bathroom``` and have no idea how long that will take.

I would recommend doing the timer portion first and get into that groove. Once you are comfortable using that technique start trying to use estimation portion.

## But What About Communication!?

In my perfect world, I have sealed myself off from people to do deep work for a large amount of time. I let all of my communications be asynchronous so I can focus on the task at hand and I take breaks on a cadence. How is this productive? For me, this has been the most effective way to use my time. I know what I have to do and I can devote all my time to that one task. So instead of wasting the time of figuring out what to do, I already know and I can just focus on the doing.

How do you keep in touch with people waiting for your reply? Truth be told, I wait until the pomodoro is over and I check my messages then. I don't like to keep people waiting but the maximum amount of time any one person will wait is 25 minutes which is not that long at all if you think about it. This is part of a practice that I'm trying to learn this year of learning to say **NO**. This has helped my mental health when working from home and I feel more productive to see how many tomatoes I can get during a single day. I highly recommend that you give it a try the next time you are alone. And if you find a way to bring the idea into an actual office, shoot me an email! I'd love to know!
