Getting the opportunity to work from home is something that I look for in a job. The ability to work from home means that I get some quiet time with my thoughts as I work and it also gives me the ability to be a little more leisurely with how I work because there is no pressure to try to get something done in between people coming over for a chat or needing some help. Don't get me wrong, I love to help people, I love to educate people on the things I've learned and to learn from their experience. But sometimes I just need time away from all of that so I can sit and code or generate more content for the Dojo. 

But working from home presents its own challeges. What I'm talking about here is focusing on work instead of dealing with all of the other office activities. Working from home is provinging me this slice of time to be "out of sight, out of mind" and completely virtual to my team and my meetings. This means that I can use this oppourtunity to embrace asynchronous communication and really get down to getting things done. But... I'm only human, I can't focus on something forever.

Or can I? Enter the Pomodoro Technique. [put link here]. This is something that I use in both my personal and professional life to get things done. What is a pomodoro you ask? Its Italian for tomato and the author just happened to have an egg timer shaped like a tomato, Hence the name. There mystery solved.

Its really quite a simple technique and it really helps me to focus. All you have to do is pick an amount of time that you want to be undisturbed, normally I choose the default of ``` 25 minutes ```. I feel like this is the optimal time for me to get things done and really focus. You set your timer and you are off to work. Once the time is up however you set a ``` 5 minute ``` timer and step away from your computer! The goal here is to take a break away from focusing. Get up, get some coffee if you drink it, walk around and stare outside, just don't focus on your task at hand. This is a break and should be treated like one. Once the ``` 5 minute ``` timer is up then its back to work again for another ``` 25 minutes ```. You can repeate this process over and over again until the task you are working on is complete. I usually allow myself to go for 3 full pomodoros with 3 breaks before I take a larger break of ``` 15 minutes ```.  

This technique is great and I would highly recommend it for productivity. There are a few caveats however that I would mention. 

- Take the longer break when it presents itself
  
  This is really key. I tried to do it before where I never took the long break and I was burnt out __for the week__ because I just couldn't take thinking anymore.

- You don't have to be strict about the timing
  
  I've had meetings and phone calls break my pomodoro early. The key is to start back up the minute you are free to get the most out of focus time. 

- Know what you are going to work on before you work on it. 
  
  This is very important. The entire point of a pomodoro is to do deep work. Spending time figuring out what you are going to do is time lost. 

## But What About Communication!?

In my perfect world I have sealed myself off from people to do deep work for a large amount of time. I let all of my communications be asynchonous so I can focus at the task at hand and I take breaks on a cadence. How is this productive? For me this has been the most effective way to use my time. I know what I have to do and I can devote all my time to that one task. So instead of wasting time of figuring out what to do, I already know and I can just focus on the doing. 

How do you keep in touch with people waiting for your reply? Truth be told, I wait until the pomodoro is over and I check my messages then. I don't like to keep people waiting but the maximum amount of time any one person will wait is 25 minutes which is not that long at all if you think about it. This is part of a practice that I'm trying to learn this year of learning to say **NO**. Its helped my mental health when working from home and I feel more productive to see how many tomatoes I can get during a single day. I highly recommend that you give it a try the next time you are alone. And if you find a way to bring the idea into an actual office, shoot me an email! I'd love to know!
